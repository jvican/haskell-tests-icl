# The January Haskell Tests 
This is a cool compilation of Haskell exercises done by Anthony J. Field.
  
> The January tests are on-line Haskell programming tests sat under examination 
conditions by first-year undergraduate students at  Imperial College at the end 
of a six-week introductory programming course. The exercises are largely well 
defined and depend only on a knowledge of Haskellâ€™s more basic language features. 
Because the exercises address a number of core problems in Computer Science 
they might also appeal to non-Haskellers who are looking for a hand-holding 
introduction to those problems and guidance on how to break them down into 
manageable chunks.  Whatever your motivation I hope you find them useful and fun.
  
You can find all the relevant information and the specifications [here](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/ajf/haskell-tests/).
This is my own repo where I share my solutions. I would like to thank Anthony
for these exercises, as I have enjoyed a lot to solve them in a functional way.
